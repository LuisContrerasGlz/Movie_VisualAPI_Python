# Distinctiveness and Complexity

Welcome to the "Movies App with API," an immersive web application designed to provide users with an engaging exploration of the latest movies. By leveraging The Movie Database (TMDb) API, this project excels in delivering an intuitive interface for browsing popular films and accessing comprehensive information.

At its core, the application focuses on simplicity and user engagement, offering a dynamic catalog of the latest movies. The seamless integration of The Movie Database API ensures that the content is consistently up-to-date, presenting users with an extensive selection of films to explore.

The distinctive features of our web application include an intuitive grid layout of movie posters and titles on the main page, immediately capturing the user's attention. To enhance the browsing experience, we've integrated pagination buttons, allowing users to navigate seamlessly through multiple pages of movie results.

Behind the scenes, the application's functionality is achieved by combining a robust back-end built with Python and Django, leveraging HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. Moreover, the mobile and multi-platform responsiveness ensures a user-friendly experience across various devices and browsers.

Explore the captivating world of cinema through our application, where a visually appealing grid of movie posters and titles awaits you. Navigate through pages of movie results effortlessly using the integrated pagination buttons, and delve into the details of your favorite movies with ease.


# File Structure

The `templates` directory holds HTML files defining the structure of the main catalog page (`articulo.html`) and the detailed movie page (`deetall.html`).

## What's contained in each file:

-pictures-master
    -ferreteriaWeb
